### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic Authentication):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ionoscloud
from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    username = 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.ContractApi(api_client)
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
depth = 0 # int | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)

    try:
        # Retrieve a Contract
        api_response = api_instance.contracts_get(pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ContractApi->contracts_get: %s\n" % e)
```

```python
from __future__ import print_function

x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)

    try:
        # Retrieve a Contract
        api_response = api_instance.contracts_get(pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
