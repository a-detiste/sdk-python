Modify IP blocks

Modify the properties of the specified IP block.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic Authentication):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ionoscloud
from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = 'https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6',
)
# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.IPBlocksApi(api_client)
    ipblock_id = 'ipblock_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the IP block.
    ipblock = ionoscloud.IpBlock() # IpBlock | The modified IP block.
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether the response is pretty-printed (with indentations and new lines). (optional) (default to True)
    depth = 0 # int | Controls the detail depth of the response objects.

# Configure Api Key access token for authorization: Token Authentication
configuration.api_key = {
    'Token Authentication': 'YOUR_API_TOKEN',

    ipblock_id = 'ipblock_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the IP block.
    ipblock = ionoscloud.IpBlock() # IpBlock | The modified IP block.
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether the response is pretty-printed (with indentations and new lines). (optional) (default to True)
    depth = 0 # int | Controls the detail depth of the response objects.  GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: Only direct properties are included; children (servers and other elements) are not included.  - depth=1: Direct properties and children references are included.  - depth=2: Direct properties and children properties are included.  - depth=3: Direct properties and children properties and children's children are included.  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)

        api_response = api_instance.ipblocks_put(ipblock_id, ipblock, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
