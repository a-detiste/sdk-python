# ionos-cloud-sdk
An enterprise-grade Infrastructure is provided as a Service (IaaS) solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API. 

The API allows you to perform a variety of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes, adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth and intuitive.

This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 5.0
- Package version: 0.0.2
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen

## Notice - this version of Python SDK is highly EXPERIMENTAL and should be used only for testing purposes not on production environments. A production ready version can be found at https://github.com/ionos-enterprise/ionos-enterprise-sdk-python.

## Requirements.

Python 2.7 and 3.4+

## Installation & Usage
### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import ionos_cloud_sdk
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import ionos_cloud_sdk
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function

import time
import ionos_cloud_sdk
from ionos_cloud_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ionos_cloud_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
configuration = ionos_cloud_sdk.Configuration(
    username = 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionos_cloud_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionos_cloud_sdk.BackupUnitApi(api_client)
    backupunit_id = 'backupunit_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the backup Unit
pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
depth = 0 # int | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)

    try:
        # Delete a Backup Unit
        api_response = api_instance.backupunits_delete(backupunit_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling BackupUnitApi->backupunits_delete: %s\n" % e)

# **datacenters_post**
> Datacenter datacenters_post(datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Create a Data Center

Virtual data centers are the foundation of the platform. They act as logical containers for all other objects you will be creating, e.g. servers. You can provision as many data centers as you want. Datacenters have their own private network and are logically segmented from each other to create isolation. You can use this POST method to create a simple datacenter or to create a datacenter with multiple objects under it such as servers and storage volumes.

# **k8s_nodepools_nodes_replace_post**
> object k8s_nodepools_nodes_replace_post(k8s_cluster_id, nodepool_id, node_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Recreate the Kubernetes node

You can recreate a single Kubernetes Node.  Managed Kubernetes starts a process which based on the nodepool's template creates & configures a new node, waits for status \"ACTIVE\", and migrates all the pods from the faulty node, deleting it once empty. While this operation occurs, the nodepool will have an extra billable \"ACTIVE\" node.

# **datacenters_servers_put**
> Server datacenters_servers_put(datacenter_id, server_id, server, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Modify a Server

Allows to modify the attributes of a Server. From v5 onwards 'allowReboot' attribute will no longer be available. For certain server property change it was earlier forced to be provided. Now this behaviour is implicit and backend will do this automatically e.g. in earlier versions, when CPU family changes, the 'allowReboot' property was required to be set to true which will no longer be the case and the server will be rebooted automatically

# **um_resources_find_by_type_and_id**
> Resource um_resources_find_by_type_and_id(resource_type, resource_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Retrieve a Resource by type.

You can retrieve a resource by using the type and its uuid. Allowed values for types are { datacenter, snapshot, image, ipblock, pcc, backupunit, k8s }. The value of resource type can also be found in the response body when you GET a list of all resources.
